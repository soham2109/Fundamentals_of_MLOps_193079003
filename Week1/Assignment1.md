	<li>In the notes of Week 1, we compared &amp; contrasted MLOps with DevOps. In this question, you need to understand what is meant by the term <strong><em>AIOps</em></strong>, &amp; then contrast it with MLOps.
<p><strong>Ans.</strong> </p>
	<ol>
		<li><em>AIOps</em>, a term coined by Gartner in 2017, is a series of multi-layered platforms that automate IT to make it more efficient, using big data, advanced analytics, and ML Techniques.<br /><em>MLOps</em> is a multidisciplinary approach to managing machine learning algorithms as ongoing products, each with its own continuous lifecycle. It's a discipline that aims to build, scale, and deploy algorithms to production consistently.</li>
		<li>AIOps automates machines while MLOps standardizes processes.</li>
